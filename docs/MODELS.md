# Models:
* ⭐ `u2net` - __U^2-Net__ model has the best quality processing. [More info](https://github.com/NathanUA/U-2-Net)
* ⭐ `u2netp` - __small version of U^2-Net__ with low quality but high processing speed. [More info](https://github.com/NathanUA/U-2-Net)
* `xception_model` - __DeepLabV3__ model with quality worse than the first two. [More info](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/deeplab)
* `mobile_net_model` - __small version of DeepLabV3__ model with quality worse than the first three. [More info](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/deeplab)
